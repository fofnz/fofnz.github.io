SP24/7 is a dedicated online contemporary art and project space, founded by Tom Hackshaw, Daniel Nield and Robert Gorrie.
<br><br>
The idea for this online space arose from the sense that current budding artists and the community are restricted in where they can exhibit due to various reasons. Artist run initiatives already exist, but they are few in number, especially in New Zealand.
<br><br>
SP24/7 aims to address this problem by providing an online space for artists, curators, writers and the like to display their work and interacts with audiences. An online space doesn't have the same costs like a physical space (rent and maintenance), and can be viewable by any audience from anywhere with an Internet connection.
<br><br>
<br><br>
We accept proposals from all times for our one week exhibition programme. There are no fees or costs of any kind; this site will always remain free.
